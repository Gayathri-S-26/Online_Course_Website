<h4>
This course helps students develop the understanding that they will need to make informed decisions using data, 
and to communicate the results effectively. The course is an introduction to the essential concepts, tools and
methods of statistics for students in business, economics and similar disciplines, although it may have wider 
interest. The focus is on concepts, reasoning, interpretation and thinking rather than computation, formulae 
and theory. Much of the work will require students to write effectively and communicate their ideas with clarity. 
The course covers two main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. 
Descriptive statistics includes collecting data and summarising and interpreting them through numerical and 
graphical techniques. Inferential statistics includes selecting and applying the correct statistical 
technique in order to make estimates or test claims about a population based on a sample. 
Topics covered may include descriptive statistics, correlation and simple regression, probability, point and 
interval estimation, hypothesis testing, multiple regression, time series analysis and index numbers.

On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Apply correctly a variety of statistical techniques, both descriptive and inferential.</li>
<li>Interpret, in plain language, the application and outcomes of statistical techniques.</li>
<li>Interpret computer output and use it to solve problems.</li>
<li>Recognize inappropriate use or interpretation of statistics in other courses, in the media and in life 
in general and comment critically on the appropriateness of this use of statistics.</li>
</ul>
